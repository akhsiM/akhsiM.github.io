# Hi, I'm Mishka.

By day, I work as an Application Support Analyst. By night, I spend my time learning Full Stack Development. As a technically inclined person, I enjoy learning about these so for me, it's also one of the more productive hobbies that I have committed myself to.

This page was created in August 2019. It is the result of my "mini project" with the following intentions:
- I have always wanted to learn a bit about front-end web development.
(*Well, if you are nitpicky, a static site isn't REALLY webdev... I agree. But I have always wanted to learn things from the ground up and establish good foundations, and I think a static site is a good starting place.*)
- I need a place to store my learning notes.
(*Public HTML pages with fancy mark-ups and code blocks are way cooler than .docx files stored on a Google Drive I say.*)
- I need a place to store my cheatsheets.
- I need a place to store my workflows.
- This place needs to be easily and readily available and accessible anytimes to me, or even my friends if necessary.

So here we are, at the front-door of my first "blog".

Bear in mind though, this page will be in a mode of ever-development. It's basically my learning lab for "webdev 101". Therefore, you'll probably walk into some sort of messes, mistakes and errors here and there.

Thank you for viewing!

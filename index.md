# Hi, I'm Mishka.

I am currently working as an Application Analyst by "trade". As an individual, I am a technically inclined person who has a strong interest in learning about all things technical-related, whether it's Dev, DevOps, SQLs or even CSS sometimes (we all know CSS isn't really a programming language!).

This page was created in August 2019. It is the result of my "mini project" with the following intentions:
- I have always wanted to learn a bit about webdev.
(*Well, if you are nitpicky, a static site isn't REALLY webdev... I agree. But I have always wanted to learn things from the ground up and establish good foundations, given pace is not an issue!*)
- I need a place to store my learning notes.
(*Public HTML pages with fancy mark-ups and code blocks are way cooler than .docx files stored on a Google Drive I say.*)
- I need a place to store my cheatsheets.
- I need a place to store my workflows.
- This place needs to be easily and readily available and accessible anytimes to me, or even my friends if necessary.

So here we are. 

Bear in mind though, this page will be in a mode of everdevelopment. It's basically my learning lab for "webdev 101". Therefore, you'll probably walk into some sort of messes, mistakes and errors here and there.

Thank you for viewing!
